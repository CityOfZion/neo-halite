componentize network status button overlay flyout

abstract nav away from vertical/horizontal

Event-driven flyout states
  - I.e., clicking hamburger doesn't close session status automatically
  - Ideally, this could be configurable flag


Main UI panes do not scroll independently, consider best approach i.e., add scroll or not
